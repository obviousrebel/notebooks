    "Table Access Protocol (TAP) services allow more direct and flexible access to astronomical data than the simpler types of IVOA standard data services. Queries are built with the SQL-like Astronomical Data Query Language (ADQL), and can include geographic / spatial queries as well as filtering on other characteristics of the data. This also allows the user fine-grained control over the returned columns, unlike the fixed set of coumns retunred from cone, image, and spectral services.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example, we'll be using the astroquery TAP/TAP+ client, which was developed by the ESAC Space Data Centre for working with the GAIA catalog, but is interoperable with other valid TAP services, including those at MAST. As an astroquery project, TAP+ documentation is available at ReadTheDocs: http://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/utils/tap.html\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using TAP+ to call the most recent version (3) of the Hubble Source Catalog TAP service at MAST. The schema is described within the service, and we'll show how to inspect it. The schema is also the same as the one available via the CasJobs interface, with an additional view added for the most common positional queries. CasJobs has its own copy of the schema documentation, which can be accessed through its own site: http://mastweb.stsci.edu/hcasjobs/\n",
